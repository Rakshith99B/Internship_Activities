    "Machine Learning (ML) is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of manually writing every rule like in traditional programming. In normal coding, developers provide both the rules and the data to get results, but in ML, we give the computer examples of data along with the correct answers, and the system learns the rules by itself. This allows computers to make predictions or decisions on new data they have never seen before. In simple terms, ML helps machines improve automatically through experience and data rather than explicit programming."
